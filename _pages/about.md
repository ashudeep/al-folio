 I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I am advised by [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/){:target="\_blank"}. I am fortunate to have [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org/), [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/){:target="\_blank"} and [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="\_blank"} on my dissertation committee. 

  My research focuses on Fairness and Responsibility aspects of Machine Learning algorithms for Search and Recommendation systems. Through my research, I envision these search and recommendation systems to form the foundation for building economically sustainable multistakeholder platforms. In my research, I have developed notions and algorithms for fair distribution of opportunity and benefits for the both the stakeholders--users as well as the content providers. 

  During my Ph.D., I have completed internships at Google Brain, Facebook Research and Microsoft Research where I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Alex Beutel](http://alexbeutel.com/), [Fernando Diaz](https://fernando.diaz.nyc/), [John Langford](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jcl/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, and also spent a summer at Carnegie Mellon University. You can find more information in the [resume](/assets/pdf/Resume_Ashudeep.pdf/).
